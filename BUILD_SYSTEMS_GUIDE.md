# Python Build Systems - Complete Guide

## Current Setup (Basic)
Your project currently uses a **simple approach**:
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Manual testing with custom scripts
- No formal packaging or distribution

This works for **development and personal projects** but isn't ideal for production or distribution.

## Professional Python Build Systems

### 1. **setuptools + setup.py** (Traditional)
```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="trading-analyzer",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "yfinance>=0.2.0",
        "pandas>=1.3.0",
        "requests>=2.25.0",
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.7",
)
```

### 2. **pyproject.toml** (Modern Standard - PEP 518)
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=45", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "trading-analyzer"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A trading analyzer with news aggregation"
dependencies = [
    "yfinance>=0.2.0",
    "pandas>=1.3.0",
    "requests>=2.25.0",
]
requires-python = ">=3.7"

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest", "black", "flake8"]
```

### 3. **Poetry** (Popular Alternative)
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "trading-analyzer"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A trading analyzer with news aggregation"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.7"
yfinance = "^0.2.0"
pandas = "^1.3.0"
requests = "^2.25.0"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0"
black = "^22.0"
```

## Recommended Modern Setup

For a **professional project**, I recommend using **pyproject.toml** because:

1. **Industry Standard** (PEP 518, 621)
2. **Tool Configuration** in one file
3. **Better Dependency Management**
4. **Packaging Support**
5. **IDE Integration**

## What Each Approach Provides

| Feature | Current | setup.py | pyproject.toml | Poetry |
|---------|---------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Dependencies | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Packaging | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Version Management | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dev Dependencies | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Lock Files | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Virtual Env Management | Manual | Manual | Manual | ✓ |
| Publishing | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Build Commands Comparison

### Current (Basic)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_build.py
```

### With setuptools
```bash
pip install -e .          # Install in development mode
python setup.py test       # Run tests
python setup.py bdist_wheel # Build distribution
```

### With pyproject.toml
```bash
pip install -e .          # Install in development mode
python -m build           # Build distribution
pytest                    # Run tests
```

### With Poetry
```bash
poetry install            # Install dependencies
poetry run pytest        # Run tests
poetry build             # Build distribution
poetry publish           # Publish to PyPI
```

## Testing Frameworks

### Current: Custom Scripts
- `test_build.py` - Custom verification
- Individual test files

### Professional: pytest
```python
# tests/test_http_client.py
import pytest
from http_client import HTTPClient

def test_http_client_creation():
    client = HTTPClient()
    assert client is not None
    client.close()

def test_http_client_with_base_url():
    client = HTTPClient(base_url="https://api.example.com")
    assert client.base_url == "https://api.example.com"
    client.close()
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, '3.10', 3.11]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e .[dev]
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

## Code Quality Tools

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
```

## Recommendation for Your Project

I suggest upgrading to **pyproject.toml** approach because:

1. **Modern Standard** - Industry best practice
2. **Better Organization** - All config in one file
3. **Packaging Ready** - Easy to distribute
4. **Tool Integration** - Works with IDEs and CI/CD
5. **Future Proof** - Python's direction

Would you like me to:
1. **Convert your project to use pyproject.toml**?
2. **Add proper testing with pytest**?
3. **Set up code quality tools (black, flake8)**?
4. **Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**?
